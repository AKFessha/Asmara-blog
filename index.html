        <h1> Asmara(ኣስመራ) </h1>
        <h2> Capital city of Eritrea </h2>
        <p>Asmara known locally as Asmera (meaning "They [feminine plural] made them unite" in Tigrinya), is the capital city
            and largest settlement in Eritrea. Home to a population of just over 800,000 inhabitants,it sits at an elevation
            of 2,325 metres (7,628 ft), the sixth highest capital in the world by altitude. The city is located at the tip
            of an escarpment that is both the northwestern edge of the Eritrean highlands and the Great Rift Valley in neighbouring
            Ethiopia. In 2017, the city was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                        <p>The city is home to the Eritrean National Museum and is known for its early 20th-century buildings,
                            including the Art Deco Cinema Impero (opened in 1937 and considered by the experts one of the
                            world's finest examples of Art Déco style building), Cubist Africa Pension, eclectic Orthodox
                            Cathedral and former Opera House, the futurist Fiat Tagliero Building, the neo-Romanesque Church
                            of Our Lady of the Rosary, Asmara, and the neoclassical Governor's Palace. The city is adorned
                            by Italian colonial villas and mansions, one prominent example being the World Bank Building.
                            Most of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so the Italians effectively managed to
                            build almost an entire city in just six years. At this time, the dictator Benito Mussolini had
                            great plans for a second Roman Empire in Africa. War cut this short, but his injection of funds
                            created the Asmara of today, which supposedly was to be a symbol that Fascism worked and is an
                            ideal system of government.

                        <p>Taxis that run in the city of Asmara start at 07:00 and end at 21:00, and can get very crowded at
                            peak times. The fare for a shared taxi is 5-10 Nakfa per seat. A contracted taxi can charge between
                            20 and 300 Nakfa so the price should be negotiated before entering the taxi
                            <br> There is a railway station in Asmara that connects the city with Massawa: the Eritrean Railway,
                            built by the Italians between 1887 and 1932, has been recently restructured.

                        <p>Four big landmarks of the city are the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and the Kidane Mehret Cathedral
                            of the Catholic faith, the Enda Mariam Cathedral of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and
                            the Al Khulafa Al Rashiudin Mosque of the Islamic faith. Christians and Muslims have lived peacefully
                            together in Asmara for centuries. The religious majority in Asmara are Orthodox Christians. The
                            population in the Central Region is 94 percent Christian (almost 89 percent Orthodox, 4 percent
                            Roman Catholic, and more than 1 percent Protestant) and 5 percent Muslim. The towns and villages
                            surrounding the city in the highlands are predominantly Christian (most places being all Christian).
                            Further, towards the lowlands, a few Muslim towns and villages are found. The Asmara Synagogue
                            is the last piece of physical evidence of the Jewish community that once resided in Eritrea.
                            Asmara also has the St George Greek Orthodox Church, Asmara on Selam St.
